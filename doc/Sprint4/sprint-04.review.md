## Iteration 04 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: 03/08/2025
 * Where: ONLINE

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process‑related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

* Teamwork / Working in Pairs/Groups: This sprint contained tasks which involved new technologies that many group members had never worked with. These technologies include GitHub Actions, Docker, E2E testing software, etc. Working in groups allowed us to split up the workload and manage the difficulties that came with these tasks. We could afford to work in groups since the main features of our website were completed last sprint.
* Determination: Although many group members were working with technologies that were new to them, everyone persevered and overcame their hard battles. This was a necessary thing to do, but it was great to see everyone put in a lot of effort!
* Organization: Specifically for planning our approach on final UI fixes and overall fixes to the website. Planning out the finishing touches to this website helped us finish these tasks as fast as possible, leaving more time for the harder and newer tasks such as Docker, E2E testing, GitHub actions, etc. 

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process‑related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

* Miscalculations and Unoriganizaed plan of action for tasks like Docker and GitHub Actions
* Delayed Communications due to Busy Schedules (end of semester)

#### Planned changes

List any process‑related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * N/A (sprint 4 is final sprint so no process-related changes to make)

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

* Chatbot is fully functioning (https://github.com/UTSC-CSCC01-Software-Engineering-I/term-group-project-c01s25-project-clubhub/tree/develop/clubhub-web/src/lib/chatbot)
* Docker and Github Actions files are set up to allow automated CI/CD (https://github.com/UTSC-CSCC01-Software-Engineering-I/term-group-project-c01s25-project-clubhub/blob/develop/docker-compose.yml) and (https://github.com/UTSC-CSCC01-Software-Engineering-I/term-group-project-c01s25-project-clubhub/tree/develop/.github/workflows)
* Users can now see previous club requests (and their status) (https://github.com/UTSC-CSCC01-Software-Engineering-I/term-group-project-c01s25-project-clubhub/blob/develop/clubhub-web/src/app/pending-club-request/page.tsx)
* Images were stored differently in the database to ensure faster load speeds (no artifact to this, but was displayed during sprint demo to TA)
* Executives can add links when editing their club (https://github.com/UTSC-CSCC01-Software-Engineering-I/term-group-project-c01s25-project-clubhub/blob/develop/clubhub-web/src/app/exec/page.tsx)

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

* N/A (sprint 4 is final sprint so everything was completed)

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

* N/A (sprint 4 is final sprint)
