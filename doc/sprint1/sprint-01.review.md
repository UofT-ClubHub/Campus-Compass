# ClubHub


## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: 15/06/2025
 * Where: ONLINE

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

* Team organization: Being able to split up the work based on every team member's strengths and weaknesses created a path for us to complete all the tasks we wanted to for this sprint.
* Using stand-up meetings/posts: With this being the first sprint, we realized how useful and essential stand-up meetings/posts were. We were able to discuss what we finished and what our goals were for the next couple days using these posts. Also, being able to see that a group member had many external difficulties causing them to struggle on their work allowed the rest of the team to help them in different ways, allowing us to complete any, and all, tasks in a timely manner.
* Consistent styling techniques: Making the decision to use Tailwind CSS classes instead of using regular, plain-old CSS allowed everyone's code to be synced, making it easier to read, test, and make any changes if necessary.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * Delayed communication on platforms such as Slack.
 * Asynchronous testing by individual users, rather than having a dedicated testing session.


#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Quick response time on Slack and other messaging platforms: This is to make sure every member is on the same page at any moment during the sprint. Communication is a vital part of a strong and connected team.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * Instagram Scraper: It was not feasible to do in this sprint because the new policies and rules set by Instagram. Although it was not completed this sprint, we have planned some new ways to implement the scraper (or something similar) in the next sprint.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

* Implementing the Instagram scrapper or a substitute. This can create a path for us in sprint 3 and onwards, as we have a lot of potential things we want to implement but it will be dependant on the implementation of the scrapper.
* Creating the ability for a user to follow a club, so we can show recommended posts based on the user's preferences.
* Fixing and adding new features to already existing pages. For example, the Club Search and Post Search Pages have been made, but there are many new features we can add to them to increase their worth. These changes (like infinite scrolling and autocompletion of user searches) will improve the pages drastically.
* Continuing to create good and well-designed front-end pages, ensuring they are intuitive for users to use and easy to skim over in a glance.
